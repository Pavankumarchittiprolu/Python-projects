# Employee Details Management System

This project is an Employee Details Management System developed using Python, Tkinter, and MySQL. It allows organizations to manage 
and store employee information in a structured manner. The system provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter,
where users can easily perform operations like adding, updating, deleting, and viewing employee details. The backend database is 
powered by MySQL to securely store and manage employee records.
